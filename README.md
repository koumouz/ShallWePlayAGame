# Would you like to play a game?

"Would You Like to Play A Game?" is a prototype in generative interactive fiction
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">large language models</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model" target="_blank">image diffusion models</a>. All the
content the player interacts with is generated in real time, creating a unique playthrough on each session.

This allows for much greater player agency as players are no longer confined to the crude text parsers of the 80s and instead can really explore
their surrounding with rich text commands. The narrative can take many turns as the LLM determines where to go based on the player input, while
ensuring some structure based on initial game prompts (to set a base scenerio and outline for the game).

The interface and gameplay was inspired by the interactive fiction games of the 1980s, which
I grew up playing (the first computer monitors I used were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome_monitor" target="_blank">
amber CRTs</a> :)

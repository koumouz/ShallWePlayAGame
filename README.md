An exploration into creative a text adventure (ahem, interactive fiction). These were some of my favorite games to play in the 1980; this project aims to replicate the base experience but to do through AI LLMs.

This allows for much greater player agency as players are no longer confined to the crude text parsers of the 80s and instead can really explore their surrounding with rich text commands. The narrative can take many turns as the LLM determines where to go based on the player input and the initial game prompts which set the base scenerio and outline for each game.

An exploration in generative text adventure games (ahem, interactive fiction). The text adventures of the 1980s were some of my favorite games to play while growing up. This project aims to capture that experience but through AI LLMs.

This allows for much greater player agency as players are no longer confined to the crude text parsers of the 80s and instead can really explore their surrounding with rich text commands. The narrative can take many turns as the LLM determines where to go based on the player input but ensure some structure based on initial game prompts to set a scenerio and outline for each game.

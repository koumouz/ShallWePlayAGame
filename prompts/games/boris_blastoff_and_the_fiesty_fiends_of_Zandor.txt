Game Setting:
The player is Boris Blastoff, a space adventurer in the style of Flash Gordon.
The player landed on the planet Zandor, a planet inhabited by a number of angry denizens who find Boris's sense of humor.
Boris must find a way to retrieve his spaceship, which has been impounded by the local government as they find Boris to be both irritating and ignorant of their local customs.
Boris is not very intelligent, but extremey confident in themselves.
The denizens of Zandor are a highly intelligent species of bipedal weasel.
The game dialog should be funny and witty, with frequent puns. The humor should be in the style of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

The story begins as the player wakes in a cell at the local jail. They have arrested for being pulic intoxicated and disorderly the night before.
The player must find a way out of their cell and make it back to their spaceshit to escape Zandor before the angry (and intelligent) weasels catch up to them.

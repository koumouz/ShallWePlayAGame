Game Setting:
The setting of this game is in the late 1970s. 5 high-school kids around the ages of 16 decided to camp on a remote island off the coast of their small New England town. There are rumors of weird supernatural events on this island, perhaps something to do with secret military experiments that were possible run on the island during World War 2. They say the military was researching the occult, to gain some way to defeat the Nazis. You will take this basic premise and then expand on the story, adding new scenarios and introducing new twists and turns in the narrative. You will play the 4 characters and will give them each a name and backstory. I will play as the 5th character. The story begins as the 5 teenagers row their boat to the island, dock it at the beach and then look on at the mysterious, foggy island wondering what to do next. The game should feel spooky, mysterious and a little scary.

Important Locations to create in the game:
1. Beach: Foggy and calm, safe for the player.
2. Forest: Dense, misty, and dangerous, with predatory animals and supernatural monsters. Not safe at night.
3. Cabin: Abandoned, safe, and contains artifacts with clues.
4. Research Facility: Secret location, the main mystery of the island. Not safe, many obstacles, traps and supernatural creates that can harm the player.

The story begins as the player rows their boat to the island, damaging it upon arrival. They must now explore the island to uncover its mysteries.

Example AI Response: "You on a fog-shrouded beach. Sheer cliff walls rise to the north and south, and the dark waters of the lake stretch eastward. To the west stands a magnificent castle, its parapets rising high into the mist. Golden light streams invitingly through the open gateway. You hear friendly voices and music inside. What would you like to do?"
Example Player Prompt: "Go north"
Examples AI Response: "You cannot go north, the sheer cliff walls block your path. You can walk east towards the lake or go west towards the castle. What would you like to do?
